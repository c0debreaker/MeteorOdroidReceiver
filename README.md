# MeteorRpiReceiver
A set of python scripts to automatically capture, decode &amp; e-mail Meteor-M2 satellite images

These scripts have been written to run on a Raspberry Pi 3 model B.

This project uses a good ol' DVB-T stick and gnuradio to capture the raw data. The processing of the raw data is performed by 'medet' (medet_arm in this case) developed by Artlav.
